<mark>Dev Container</mark> offer a consistent and reproducible development environment, ensuring uniformity across all developersâ€™ setups. By isolating the development environment from the host machine, they help prevent conflicts and enhance security. Additionally, they ensure that all necessary tools, libraries, and dependencies are available and properly configured

## Requirements

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/): used to create and manage the containerized development environment
2. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension
3. [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Optional but offers benefits like improved file system performance, Linux compatibility, and seamless integration with Docker. You can also check your [git configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git).

## Configuration

You need a `.devcontainer` folder in your project with a `devcontainer.json` file that defines the development environment. You can create one from scratch or use a predefined dev container configuration. To do this, access the <mark>Visual Studio Code</mark> Command Palette (_Ctrl+Shift+P_) then type _Add Dev Container Configuration Files_ and choose the definition you want to use. Note that for performance and compatibility issues, it is better to running a <mark>WSL</mark> project from the home folder.

_Example of devcontainer.json_:

```json
{
    "name": "EtnMn website",
    "build": {
        "dockerfile": "Dockerfile"
    },
    "remoteUser": "node",
    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers-contrib/features/pnpm:2": {}
    },
    "customizations": {
        "vscode": {
            "extensions": [
                "astro-build.astro-vscode",
                "EditorConfig.EditorConfig",
                "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
                "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
                "bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss"
            ]
        }
    },
    "mounts": [
        "type=bind,source=${localEnv:HOME}${localEnv:USERPROFILE}/.ssh,target=/home/node/.ssh,readonly"
    ]
}
```

Let's break down the different parts of this JSON object:

- _name_: Specifies the name of the development container. This name is displayed by _VS Code_
- _build_: Specifies the Dockerfile to use for building the development container. For simplicity and faster setup, you can instead use the property _image_ to use a pre-built image
- _remoteUser_: Specifies the user's name development container
- _features_: Installs tools and languages from a pre-defined set of [Features](https://github.com/devcontainers/features) or even your own.
- _customizations/vscode_: Customizes to the Visual Studio Code editor inside the development container. In this case, it includes a list of extensions to install.
- _mount_: Defines file system mappings to be used in the development container. In this case, it mounts the local SSH directory to the `.ssh` directory inside the container. This allows the container to access MSL [SSH keys](https://logfetch.com/git-ssh-keys/) in order to commit on <mark>Github</mark> by SSH.

## Run the container

Once you start _VS Code_ from _WSL_, you'll see a message about `Installing VS Code Server`. It allows you to use Visual Studio Code on your _Windows_ machine while seamlessly interacting with the _WSL_ environment.

You can run the container by selecting _VS Code_ command `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`. A shortcut is also available in the bottom left corner of the IDE. Once the build is complete, _VS Code_ will reopen the project inside the container and install extensions. You can now start coding.
